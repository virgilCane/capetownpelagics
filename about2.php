                     We're glad that through our pelagics we've been able to play our small role in helping to save albatrosses,
                     not only by direct donations, but also by raising awareness, 
                     and providing an opportunity for people to see albatrosses and becoming inspired for conservation. 
                     We also take out albatross researchers for free on research trips.

                                        <p>David grew up in Pretoria but lived in Durban for two years (where he was the chair of Birdlife Port Natal) and now resides in Cape Town. 
                                            Although he has visited the Kruger National Park numerous times as a child (and many more since), he only really started birding around 25 years ago while, 
                                            as a young geologist, he bought a guide to ID the birds he saw in the field. 
                                            Birding has since turned into a passion and profession. </p>

                                        <p>When he first moved to Cape Town, he volunteered at the Animal (Avian) Demography Unit at the University of Cape Town where he was involved with bird ringing, as well as African Black Oystercatcher and African Penguin research. 
                                            He subsequently worked for an environmental consultancy as a contaminated land specialist. </p> 
                                        <p>Not only has David travelled and birded widely throughout South Africa, but he has birded in and guided birding trips to Namibia, Botswana and southern Zambia. 
                                            He is also an enthusiastic bird and wildlife photographer. </p>
